    <h2>In year of drama, Pence quietly advances conservative agenda</h2>
    <p> Pence is a really bad vicepresident. Trump didn't know what he was doing when he elected him. In the run-up to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to recognize Jerusalem as
       Israel’s capital, Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative Christian who had long advocated for the move, did something he does only selectively: speak up. His behind-the-scenes
        influence - described in interviews with more than two dozen conservative activists, lawmakers and administration officials - adds another dimension to a man often ridiculed for his
         public obsequiousness to his boss.As Pence has put his stamp on policy, he has strengthened his ties with conservative activists, donors and lawmakers - alliances that would serve
          him well should he decide to launch his own presidential bid in the future.

    <h2>Trump administration appeals against 'Dreamer' immigrant ruling to top court</h2>
    <p>Trump got trolled by U.S. Supreme Court.The U.S. Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to quickly overturn a lower court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s move
       to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.The Justice Department did not file an emergency application that, if
       successful, would result in the judge’s ruling being put on hold within days. That means the program will remain in effect until the Supreme Court resolves the case.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court/trump-administration-appeals-against-dreamer-immigrant-ruling-to-top-court-idUSKBN1F804O">Read more</a>
